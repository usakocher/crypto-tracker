# Cryptocurrency Tracker
## Overview
This app provides real-time information of 100 different cryptocurrencies. It frames this information within the context of a fake company, posing to be a central
hub of information for the normal investor.

## Methodology
The first thing I did is identify the API I wanted to use and the information I wanted to use from it. I set up my fetch function through axios and then framed the information
in a table. I provided formatting to better understand the data and an extra analytic to gauge trends. Following this, I added the pages around it so it looked like real company's
website.

## Challenges
The main challenge with this project was the formatting. There are a couple tables and formatting those tables took some trial and error. The other challenge would be to make
this app responsive, right now it is not but it could be adapted in the future.

## Future Potential
There are things to add in the future. The tracker itself and other aspects could be held behind an authentication protected route, so that you would have to sign in with a
registered account to access it. This would add the ability to create a watchlist of different currencies and possibly custom email alerts based on currency performance.
There is also the potential to provide a more robust snapshot of each currency with graphs and additional analytics. All of these though would take more time.
